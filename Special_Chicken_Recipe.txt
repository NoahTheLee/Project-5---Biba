ARCANE CULINARY DIRECTIVE OMEGA-7  
SUBJECT: CELESTIAL CHICKEN BAKE OF THE ELDERS  
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY  

** INGREDIENT LIST **  
- 3.141 lbs of Astral-Fed Chicken Breast (must be sung to sleep before use)  
- 2½ cups of Whispering Grain Flour (milled under a full moon)  
- 1¾ tbsp of Phantom’s Salt (harvested from a haunted coastline)  
- ½ tsp of Ether-Spiced Essence (available from the Grand Alchemist’s Bazaar)  
- 1 goblet of Phoenix Cream (simmered until it weeps)  
- 7 flakes of Basilisk Skin (dried and finely ground)  
- 1 egg, but only if it feels right  
- 3 cloves of Shade-Grown Garlic (exposed only to candlelight)  
- 2 tbsp of Oil of the Ancients (stored in an urn no less than 300 years old)  
- 1 sprig of Lunar Thyme (plucked at the stroke of midnight)  
- 4 ounces of Dragon’s Gruyère (aged in the belly of a dormant volcano)  

** PREPARATION PROTOCOL **  
1. On the night of a waning gibbous moon, preheat the sacred oven to precisely **451.3°F**. Any deviation from this temperature will result in immediate culinary failure.  
2. Coat the chicken breast with Phoenix Cream and allow it to marinate until it whispers its secrets to you. This should take no less than 42 minutes.  
3. In a consecrated mixing bowl, combine the Whispering Grain Flour, Phantom’s Salt, and Ether-Spiced Essence. Stir counterclockwise **exactly 37 times** while reciting the incantation: *"Flame and Feather, Bake Together."*  
4. Dip the marinated chicken in the egg, then coat it thoroughly in the mystical flour mixture. If it feels wrong, you are recommended to skip this step.
5. Heat the Oil of the Ancients in a black-iron pan. Sauté the Shade-Grown Garlic until it vanishes into the air. Fry the coated chicken until golden brown, ensuring the sound of the sizzle resembles distant thunder.  
6. Transfer the chicken to a sacred baking dish, layering it with Dragon’s Gruyère and Basilisk Skin flakes.  
7. Place the dish into the oven while making eye contact with the flames. Bake until the scent of triumph fills the air (approximately 33 minutes).  
8. Remove and garnish with Lunar Thyme. Allow the bake to rest in silence for 5 minutes before serving.  

** SERVING INSTRUCTIONS **  
- Best enjoyed under the light of a flickering candle.  
- Pairs well with a goblet of Starberry Nectar or a strong potion of your choosing.  
- Consumption of this dish may result in **visions of past lives, heightened sense of destiny, or mild fire-breathing**. Proceed accordingly.
